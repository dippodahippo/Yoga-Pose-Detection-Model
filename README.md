# Yoga-Pose-Detection-Model

## This model was created as a part of my Engineering Clinics project, and uses basic CNN (4 layers) in order to analyse the images. The dataset size is 2142 images, and was trained over 100 epochs with a batch size of 32. 
The dataset was collected by our own teammates and is not available for public use.
